# RMX2072 AOSP Project

Independent Android platform research and porting project for the **realme X50 Pro Player Edition (RMX2072 / bladerunner_48m)**, powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 (SM8250/Kona).

The long-term goal is to bring a current AOSP-based Android release to the device and investigate a maintainable modern kernel path, including Android Generic Kernel Image (GKI).

> **Project status: Device unlocked; stock baseline captured; build experiments beginning.** Stock F.20 Android boots after unlock and original ABL/OCDT restoration. No project-built kernel or Android 17 / 6.18 image has been boot-tested yet.

Execution path: **GitHub Actions kernel/driver builds + official Android 17 ARM64 GSI + local USB hardware validation**. See [build execution](docs/BUILD_EXECUTION.md), the [captured device baseline](docs/DEVICE_BASELINE_2026-11-06.md), and the manually triggered [Legacy Kernel Build](.github/workflows/legacy-kernel-build.yml).

## Goals

- Build and boot an AOSP-based Android 17 system on RMX2072.
- First establish a known-good baseline using the existing device tree, vendor components and a compatible kernel.
- Inventory the official Realme kernel sources, community device trees, proprietary vendor components and firmware dependencies.
- Investigate migration from the legacy Qualcomm 4.19 kernel lineage toward a modern Android Common Kernel / GKI branch.
- Preserve a reproducible build, test and recovery process.

## Target device

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Device | realme X50 Pro Player Edition |
| Model | RMX2072 |
| Device codename | bladerunner_48m |
| SoC | Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 |
| Platform | SM8250 / Kona |
| Architecture | ARM64 |
| Android target | Android 17 (AOSP) |
| Kernel research target | GKI / ACK 6.18 |
| Known legacy kernel lineage | Linux 4.19.x |

The exact partition layout, boot image header version, AVB state, firmware revision and hardware component variants must be verified on the physical device before flashing.

## Engineering principles

1. **Bootable milestones first.** Keep a recoverable stock baseline and validate each change independently.
2. **Separate system, kernel and vendor work.** AOSP/GSI, GKI and proprietary vendor compatibility are related but distinct tracks.
3. **Prefer upstream implementations.** Reuse upstream Linux and Android Common Kernel code where suitable; port downstream code only where necessary.
4. **Do not assume GKI compatibility.** A legacy kernel with module support is not automatically GKI. KMI, module ABI, boot flow and vendor interfaces must be validated.
5. **Keep proprietary material out of Git.** Do not commit vendor blobs, firmware, factory images, keys, personal data or other files without clear redistribution rights. Record extraction instructions and hashes instead.
6. **Document test evidence.** Mark every feature as untested, build-tested, boot-tested or hardware-tested.

## Current status

- [x] GitHub repository created.
- [x] First-pass driver migration matrix and dependency map documented from pinned source evidence.
- [x] Confirm exact device model and F.20 firmware build from the handset; stock boot after unlock verified.
- [x] Capture partition map, boot image metadata and AVB status.
- [ ] Archive and hash the stock firmware and recovery images locally.
- [ ] Complete source and proprietary-component inventory.
- [ ] Reproduce an existing community ROM/device-tree build.
- [ ] Boot an Android 17 GSI on a compatible baseline.
- [ ] Evaluate modern ACK/GKI kernel migration.
- [ ] Validate hardware features and recovery/OTA strategy.

## Safety

Kernel and partition experiments can permanently damage device availability or erase data. Keep a verified stock firmware package, working recovery/EDL path and backups before any bootloader, partition or flashing operation. Never flash an image solely because it compiles.

## License

No project-wide license is declared yet. Each upstream source retains its own license. Before publishing code, identify the applicable licenses and add an appropriate license and attribution notices.
